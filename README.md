# What I learned
I found this project challenging to being with, once I understood the structure and the order in which the instructions needed to be it became a lot easier. With more knowledge I would like to come back to this and play around with some of the styling. I self-taught about 'rem' and 'vh' use in CSS and how they help style the content. 

# Continued development
I would like to try and learn and understand Javascript more and learn how to use it to its full potential. 

# Challenges that arose
The images worked well in chrome, Explorer and on mobile view. I struggled with getting the font size suitable for mobile view and for laptop/desktop viewing.
